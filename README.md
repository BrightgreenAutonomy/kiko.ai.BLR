This repo contains documentation, latex files (overleaf submodules) and other related resources about simulations and analysis of the simulation results. 

## NOTE: Initialize overleaf submodules:

If you are pulling this repo for the first time you will not be able to see the submodule contents. To have them locally one has to initialise the modules. Do the following commands in the git repo.


```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
